Create a video recorder by using python

First install the Library:
pip install sounddevice numpy wavio

Starting a program by python
  
import sounddevice as sd  
import numpy as np  
import wavio  

def record_audio(duration, sample_rate=44100):  
    """Record audio for a given duration and sample rate."""  
    print("Recording...")  
    audio_data = sd.rec(int(duration * sample_rate), samplerate=sample_rate, channels=2, dtype='int16')  
    sd.wait()  # Wait until recording is finished  
    print("Recording finished.")  
    return audio_data  

def save_audio(filename, audio_data, sample_rate=44100):  
    """Save the recorded audio data to a WAV file."""  
    wavio.write(filename, audio_data, sample_rate, sampwidth=2)  
    print(f"Audio saved as {filename}")  

def main():  
    """Main function to run the voice recorder."""  
    duration = float(input("Enter the duration of the recording in seconds: "))  
    filename = input("Enter the filename to save the recording (with .wav extension): ")  
    
    audio_data = record_audio(duration)  
    save_audio(filename, audio_data)
